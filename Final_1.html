            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                I have a large number of reality long walks around my school. The most notable of these is the walk from my Math class in room W547 to my English class in room E406. There are two paths in which I can follow, the southern path and the northern path. My instinct was that the southern path was quicker was that true. I decided to find out.
            </p>
            <h1>My Question Was</h1>
            <p>
                What is the fastest way to get from the west to the east building of Cherry Creek High School? Specifically from W547 to E406 during the transition from 7th to 8th period.
            </p>
            <h1>My Data</h1>
            <p>
                The data was recorded by starting a stopwatch upon leaving my Math class then when I got to my English class seeing how much time had elapsed.
            </p>
            <h1>My Analysis</h1>
            <p>
                A majority of the leaving times were at about 2:35 however when I took the south path I was able to arrive earlier than if I took the north path.
            </p>

            <h1>My Answer</h1>
            <p>Yes, the south path is faster.</p>
